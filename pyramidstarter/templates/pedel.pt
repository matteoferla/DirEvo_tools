                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Given a library of <i>L</i> sequences, comprising
                    variants of a sequence of <i>N</i> nucleotides, into which random point
                    mutations have been introduced, we wish to calculate the expected number
                    of distinct sequences in the library. (Typically assuming <i>L</i> > 10,
                    <i>N</i> > 5, and the mean number of mutations per sequence <i>m</i> <
                    0.1 x <i>N</i>).</p>
                <h3>Example (<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#pedel_example"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"
                                                                                aria-hidden="true"></i> show</a>)
                </h3>
                <div class="collapse" id="pedel_example">
                    <p>Saab-Rincon et al (2001, <i>Protein Eng.</i>, <b>14</b>, 149-155)
                        constructed a library of 5 million clones with a single round of epPCR
                        on a 700 bp gene. Sequencing 10 of these, indicated an error rate of
                        3-4 nucleotide substitutions per daughter sequence. Entering <i>L</i>
                        = 5000000, <i>N</i> = 700 and <i>m</i> = 3.5 into the base PEDEL sever
                        page, and clicking 'Calculate', shows that the expected number of distinct
                        sequences in the library is 4.153 x 10^6, or about 4.2 million.</p>
                    <p>
                        If you follow the link to 'detailed statistics' and, once again, enter
                        <i>L</i> = 5000000, <i>N</i> = 700 and <i>m</i> = 3.5 and click
                        'Calculate', you get a breakdown of library statistics for each of
                        the sub-libraries comprising all those daughter sequences with exactly
                        <i>x</i> base substitutions (<i>x</i> = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).</p>
                    <p>
                        For example the first line of the table shows that <b>Px</b> = 3.02%
                        of the library (i.e. <b>Lx</b> = 1.51 x 10^5 daughter sequences) have
                        <i>x</i> = 0 base substitutions (i.e. they are identical to the parent
                        sequence). The total number of possible variants with 0 base
                        substitutions is, of course, <b>Vx</b> = 1 (just the parent sequence)
                        and the total number of distinct sequences with 0 base substitutions
                        present in the library is, similarly, <b>Cx</b> = 1. The completeness
                        of the <i>x</i> = 0 sub-library is <b>Cx/Vx</b> = 100%. The
                        redundancy of this sub-library - i.e. wasted duplication - is
                        <b>Lx-Cx</b> = 1.51 x 10^5.</p>
                    <p>
                        You also have the option to plot this data by following the 'Plot this
                        data' link. Choose the statistic to plot and whether or not to use a
                        logscale on the y-axis. For example, a plot of <b>Px</b> or <b>Lx</b>
                        gives a Poisson distribution. A plot of <b>Vx</b> shows how the
                        number of possible variants increases very rapidly as the number of
                        base substitutions is increased. A plot of <b>Cx</b> shows how the
                        expected number of distinct sequences in the sub-libraries initially
                        increases - limited by the number of possible variants, <b>Vx</b> - and
                        then decreases - limited by the size of the sub-library, <b>Lx</b>. A
                        plot of <b>Lx-Cx</b> shows the extent of wasted duplication in the
                        lower <i>x</i>-value sub-libraries.</p>
                    <p>
                        Returning to the base PEDEL server page, you can follow links to plot
                        the expected number of distinct sequences in a library for a range of
                        mutation rates, library sizes or sequence lengths. The third option
                        probably won't be very useful, but the first two will help you to
                        decide what library size to aim for in order to obtain a given
                        diversity, and what mutation rate to use to maximize the diversity for
                        a given library size.</p>
                    <p>
                        For example, follow the 'mutation rates' link, enter <i>L</i> =
                        5000000, <i>N</i> = 700 and <i>m</i> = 0.2 - 20, and click
                        'Calculate'. From the plot, you can see that the expected number of
                        distinct sequences increases rapidly with <i>m</i> until <i>m</i> ~ 5,
                        and then levels off with < 10% redundancy in the library. On the
                        other hand, if you chose <i>m</i> ~ 1.5, then the library would be
                        about 60% redundant. After selecting an optimal mutation rate
                        <i>m</i>, you can go back to the 'detailed statistics' page to check
                        the expected completeness of the <i>x</i> = 0, 1, 2, 3,
                        ... sub-libraries.</p>

                <div class="collapse" id="pedel_caveats">
                    <p>PEDEL uses a generic Poisson model of sequence mutations.
                        There are a couple of simplifications that you should be aware of:

                    <ul>

                        <li>All base substitution are assumed equally likely. In reality,
                            under error-prone conditions, the polymerase favours some
                            substitutions over others. This has the effect of reducing the
                            expected number of distinct sequences compared with the PEDEL
                            predictions. This is in fact not as big an issue as you might
                            expect. Using the notation from the 'detailed statistics' page (see
                            link on base PEDEL server page), this is not an issue when the
                            number of possible variants <b>Vx</b> is much greater than the
                            sub-library size <b>Lx</b> (i.e. large <i>x</i> values), since here
                            there are so many possible variants that there is little duplication
                            within the sub-library even if there is strong bias. Conversely, if
                            <b>Lx</b> is much greater than <b>Vx</b> (i.e. small <i>x</i>
                            values) then, unless the bias is very strong, nearly all the
                            possible variants will still be sampled. Note that it is now
                            possible, by using sequential PCR amplifications with two different
                            polymerases that have opposite substitution biases, to produce
                            unbiased libraries.

                        <li>Inherent to the PCR process used to produce epPCR libraries, is
                            amplification bias: any mutation introduced in an early PCR cycle,
                            will be present in a significant fraction of the final library. In
                            practice, researchers use a variety of techniques to reduce
                            amplification bias - e.g. reduce the number of epPCR cycles and
                            combine a number of individual libraries. For example, one might
                            start with 10^9 identical parent sequences; amplify them in an epPCR
                            to 10^15 sequences; and, after ligation and transformation of
                            <i>E. coli</i>, end up with a library of 10^7 sequences. Any
                            amplification bias would have a maximum frequency of only 1 in 10^9
                            so would not show up in the final library.

                        <li>During the PCR cycles, different parent sequences may be
                            amplified a different number of times. However, empirically, the
                            end result is a library with a Poisson distribution of mutations
                            (e.g. Cadwell R.C., Joyce G.F., 1992, Randomization of genes by PCR
                            mutagenesis, <i>PCR Methods Appl.</i>, <b>2</b>, 28-33). <b>But see
                                also this <a href=pedelpcrdist.html>note</a>.</b>

                        <li>Any biases in library construction will decrease the actual
                            number of distinct variants represented in the library. In such
                            cases, PEDEL provides the user with a useful upper bound on the
                            diversity present in the library.

                <p>In our paper (Firth &amp; Patrick, 2005), we assumed a Poisson
distribution to determine the fraction of sequences in an epPCR
library that contain exactly 0, 1, 2, 3, ... mutations, given the mean
number of mutations, <i>m</i>, per sequence.<br><br>

Since publication of Firth &amp Patrick (2005), however, Drummond et
al. (2005) have revisited the pioneering work of Sun (1995) and
provided experimental evidence in support of his more accurate
equation describing the distribution of <i>m</i>. This 'PCR
distribution' takes into account the number of PCR thermal cycles
<i>ncycles</i> and the PCR efficiency <i>eff</i> (i.e. the probability
that any particular sequence is duplicated in a given PCR cycle).  We
have therefore now included the PCR distribution as an optional
alternative to the Poisson distribution in PEDEL.<br><br>

For large <i>m</i>, small <i>ncycles</i>, or low <i>eff</i>, the PCR
distribution is broader than the Poisson distribution.  For low
<i>m</i>, large <i>ncycles</i> and large <i>eff</i>, the PCR
distribution approximates the Poisson distribution.
In a 'typical' epPCR (e.g. <i>ncycles</i> = 30, <i>eff</i> = 0.6,
<i>m</i> = 4), the estimated total number of distinct sequences in a
library typically agrees to within 5% for the two distributions, though
the sub-library statistics can show more variation.<br><br>

If you know <i>ncycles</i> and <i>eff</i>, then we recommend that you
use the PCR distribution instead of the Poisson distribution.
Drummond et al. (2005) use the formula <i>d</i> =
<i>ncycles</i> &times <i>eff</i>, where <i>d</i> is the number of
doublings.  For example, if you start with 10^9 identical parent
sequences and amplify them in an epPCR to 10^15 sequences, then you
have had about <i>d</i> = 20 doublings (10^9 &times 2^20 ~= 10^15),
and you can calculate <i>eff</i> = <i>d</i> &divide; <i>ncycles</i>.
Actually the <i>d</i> = <i>ncycles</i> &times <i>eff</i> formula is
wrong.  The correct formula is 2^d = (1+eff)^ncycles, so that the
efficiency is given by eff = 2^(d/ncycles) -
1 (<a href=/cgi-bin/aef/PCReff.pl>PCR efficiency calculator</a>).<br><br><br>
