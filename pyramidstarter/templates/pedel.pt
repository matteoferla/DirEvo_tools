                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Given a library of <i>L</i> sequences, comprising
                        variants of a sequence of <i>N</i> nucleotides, into which random point
                        mutations have been introduced, we wish to calculate the expected number
                        of distinct sequences in the library. (Typically assuming <i>L</i> > 10,
                        <i>N</i> > 5, and the mean number of mutations per sequence <i>m</i> <
                        0.1 x <i>N</i>).</p>
                    <h3>Example (<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#pedel_example"><i class="fa fa-caret-down"
                                                                                    aria-hidden="true"></i> show</a>)
                    </h3>
                    <div class="collapse" id="pedel_example">
                        <p>Saab-Rincon et al (2001, <i>Protein Eng.</i>, <b>14</b>, 149-155)
                            constructed a library of 5 million clones with a single round of epPCR
                            on a 700 bp gene. Sequencing 10 of these, indicated an error rate of
                            3-4 nucleotide substitutions per daughter sequence. Entering <i>L</i>
                            = 5000000, <i>N</i> = 700 and <i>m</i> = 3.5 into the base PEDEL sever
                            page, and clicking 'Calculate', shows that the expected number of distinct
                            sequences in the library is 4.153 x 10^6, or about 4.2 million.</p>
                        <p>
                            If you follow the link to 'detailed statistics' and, once again, enter
                            <i>L</i> = 5000000, <i>N</i> = 700 and <i>m</i> = 3.5 and click
                            'Calculate', you get a breakdown of library statistics for each of
                            the sub-libraries comprising all those daughter sequences with exactly
                            <i>x</i> base substitutions (<i>x</i> = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).</p>
                        <p>
                            For example the first line of the table shows that <b>Px</b> = 3.02%
                            of the library (i.e. <b>Lx</b> = 1.51 x 10^5 daughter sequences) have
                            <i>x</i> = 0 base substitutions (i.e. they are identical to the parent
                            sequence). The total number of possible variants with 0 base
                            substitutions is, of course, <b>Vx</b> = 1 (just the parent sequence)
                            and the total number of distinct sequences with 0 base substitutions
                            present in the library is, similarly, <b>Cx</b> = 1. The completeness
                            of the <i>x</i> = 0 sub-library is <b>Cx/Vx</b> = 100%. The
                            redundancy of this sub-library - i.e. wasted duplication - is
                            <b>Lx-Cx</b> = 1.51 x 10^5.</p>
                        <p>
                            You also have the option to plot this data by following the 'Plot this
                            data' link. Choose the statistic to plot and whether or not to use a
                            logscale on the y-axis. For example, a plot of <b>Px</b> or <b>Lx</b>
                            gives a Poisson distribution. A plot of <b>Vx</b> shows how the
                            number of possible variants increases very rapidly as the number of
                            base substitutions is increased. A plot of <b>Cx</b> shows how the
                            expected number of distinct sequences in the sub-libraries initially
                            increases - limited by the number of possible variants, <b>Vx</b> - and
                            then decreases - limited by the size of the sub-library, <b>Lx</b>. A
                            plot of <b>Lx-Cx</b> shows the extent of wasted duplication in the
                            lower <i>x</i>-value sub-libraries.</p>
                        <p>
                            Returning to the base PEDEL server page, you can follow links to plot
                            the expected number of distinct sequences in a library for a range of
                            mutation rates, library sizes or sequence lengths. The third option
                            probably won't be very useful, but the first two will help you to
                            decide what library size to aim for in order to obtain a given
                            diversity, and what mutation rate to use to maximize the diversity for
                            a given library size.</p>
                        <p>
                            For example, follow the 'mutation rates' link, enter <i>L</i> =
                            5000000, <i>N</i> = 700 and <i>m</i> = 0.2 - 20, and click
                            'Calculate'. From the plot, you can see that the expected number of
                            distinct sequences increases rapidly with <i>m</i> until <i>m</i> ~ 5,
                            and then levels off with < 10% redundancy in the library. On the
                            other hand, if you chose <i>m</i> ~ 1.5, then the library would be
                            about 60% redundant. After selecting an optimal mutation rate
                            <i>m</i>, you can go back to the 'detailed statistics' page to check
                            the expected completeness of the <i>x</i> = 0, 1, 2, 3,
                            ... sub-libraries.</p>

                        <p>PEDEL uses a generic Poisson model of sequence mutations.
                            There are a couple of simplifications that you should be aware of:

                        <ul>

                            <li>All base substitution are assumed equally likely. In reality,
                                under error-prone conditions, the polymerase favours some
                                substitutions over others. This has the effect of reducing the
                                expected number of distinct sequences compared with the PEDEL
                                predictions. This is in fact not as big an issue as you might
                                expect. Using the notation from the 'detailed statistics' page (see
                                link on base PEDEL server page), this is not an issue when the
                                number of possible variants <b>Vx</b> is much greater than the
                                sub-library size <b>Lx</b> (i.e. large <i>x</i> values), since here
                                there are so many possible variants that there is little duplication
                                within the sub-library even if there is strong bias. Conversely, if
                                <b>Lx</b> is much greater than <b>Vx</b> (i.e. small <i>x</i>
                                values) then, unless the bias is very strong, nearly all the
                                possible variants will still be sampled. Note that it is now
                                possible, by using sequential PCR amplifications with two different
                                polymerases that have opposite substitution biases, to produce
                                unbiased libraries.

                            <li>Inherent to the PCR process used to produce epPCR libraries, is
                                amplification bias: any mutation introduced in an early PCR cycle,
                                will be present in a significant fraction of the final library. In
                                practice, researchers use a variety of techniques to reduce
                                amplification bias - e.g. reduce the number of epPCR cycles and
                                combine a number of individual libraries. For example, one might
                                start with 10^9 identical parent sequences; amplify them in an epPCR
                                to 10^15 sequences; and, after ligation and transformation of
                                <i>E. coli</i>, end up with a library of 10^7 sequences. Any
                                amplification bias would have a maximum frequency of only 1 in 10^9
                                so would not show up in the final library.

                            <li>During the PCR cycles, different parent sequences may be
                                amplified a different number of times. However, empirically, the
                                end result is a library with a Poisson distribution of mutations
                                (e.g. Cadwell R.C., Joyce G.F., 1992, Randomization of genes by PCR
                                mutagenesis, <i>PCR Methods Appl.</i>, <b>2</b>, 28-33). <b>But see
                                    also this <a href=pedelpcrdist.html>note</a>.</b>

                            <li>Any biases in library construction will decrease the actual
                                number of distinct variants represented in the library. In such
                                cases, PEDEL provides the user with a useful upper bound on the
                                diversity present in the library.

                        <p>PEDEL-AA is an extension to amino acid sequences of the original
                            nucleotide version of PEDEL (see links to publications and
                            <a href="/static/pedelAA_math_notes.pdf">mathematics notes</a> from the statistics
                            <a href="/">home</a> page). Due to the more complex problem
                            of estimating diversity and completeness at the amino acid level (as
                            opposed to nucleotides and codons), there are some major differences
                            in the algorithms and a few extra approximations. A brief description
                            of the procedure follows.</p>
                        <p>First, to recapitulate the nucleotide version of PEDEL: As discussed
                            in the <a href="/static/pedelAA_math_notes.pdf">mathematics notes</a>, for the nucleotide
                            version, if the input library is conceptually divided into
                            sub-libraries Lx (x=0,1,2,...) where the sub-library Lx comprises all
                            variants in the library with exactly x nucleotide substitutions, then
                            the PEDEL scenario divides into two regions:

                        <ol>

                            <li> where Lx is large compared with Vx (the number of possible
                                variants with exactly x substitutions) then Cx (the expected number
                                of distinct sequences in Lx) is approximately equal to Vx, and
                            </li>

                            <li> where Lx is small compared with Vx, then Cx is approximately
                                equal to Lx.
                            </li>

                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            In the transition region (where Lx ~ Vx) we can calculate Cx with
                            the formula Cx ~ Vx(1-exp(-Lx/Vx)). This is based on the assumption
                            that all variants in Vx are equiprobable, so the mean number of
                            occurrences in the sub-library Lx of each variant in Vx is Lx/Vx and,
                            assuming Poisson statistics, the probability that any given variant is
                            present in the sub-library is 1-exp(-Lx/Vx), so the expected number of
                            distinct variants present in the sub-library is Cx ~
                            Vx(1-exp(-Lx/Vx)).</p>
                        <p>In the more complex scenario presented in PEDEL-AA, the assumption of
                            equiprobable variants breaks down for two reasons: (i) we have
                            introduced a full 4 x 4 nucleotide substitution matrix (in particular
                            the transition:transversion ratio is not assumed to be unity), and
                            (ii) even if nucleotide substitutions were equiprobable, the
                            corresponding amino acid substitutions are not. However we may still
                            borrow some concepts from the equiprobable nucleotide version of PEDEL
                            - namely, (1) when Lx is small compared with Vx, then Cx is
                            approximately equal to Lx, and (2) when Lx is large compared with Vx
                            then Cx is approximately equal to Vx. However these concepts need
                            some refining, as follows.</p>

                        <ol>

                            <li> Instead of x counting the number of nucleotide substitutions, we
                                now let x count the number of amino acid substitutions
                                (i.e. non-synonymous, non-stop codon, substitutions). Note that the
                                substitution rate on the PEDEL-AA input form is the mean number
                                of <i>nucleotide</i> substitutions, <i>nsubst</i>, per variant but,
                                using this, the programme calculates the expected mean number of
                                nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions per variant. The probability
                                distribution, P(x_nt), of the number of nucleotide substitutions,
                                x_nt, per variant may be assumed to follow
                                the <a href=pedelpcrdist.html>PCR distribution</a> (with
                                mean <i>nsubst</i>, and the extra parameters <i>ncycles</i>
                                and <i>eff</i>, respectively the number of PCR cycles and the PCR
                                <a href=/cgi-bin/aef/PCReff.pl>efficiency</a>). Separate statistics
                                are also calculated assuming that the number of nucleotide
                                substitutions per variant follows a Poisson distribution (with the
                                single parameter <i>nsubst</i>), and these results may be used if the
                                PCR <i>ncycles</i> and <i>eff</i> parameters are unknown.
                            </li>
                            <p>
                                The probabilities of variants being truncated (i.e. containing
                                introduced stop codons) are then subtracted from the P(x_nt)
                                distributions. Clearly this is an increasing function of x_nt and, by
                                x_nt = 100, typically less than 0.6% of variants are stop-codon free.
                                Note that the P(x_nt) will no longer sum up to unity; instead (after
                                discarding indel-containing variants) they sum up
                                to <i>L_eff</i> / <i>L_tot</i>, where <i>L_eff</i> is the 'effective'
                                library size (i.e. the number of variants with no indels or stop
                                codons) and <i>L_tot</i> is the total library size (albeit again
                                excluding variants with indels).</p>
                            <p>
                                Next, the Poisson and PCR P(x_nt) distributions are redistributed into
                                amino acid P(x_aa) distributions. First the mean number, <i>frac</i>,
                                of nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions per nucleotide substitution
                                (given that the nucleotide substitution doesn't produce a stop codon)
                                is calculated. Typically <i>frac</i> ~ 2/3. For each x_nt, the
                                number of nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions resulting from
                                exactly x_nt nucleotide substitutions is assumed to follow a binomial
                                distribution, B(x_nt,<i>frac</i>) (i.e. x_nt 'trials'; probability of
                                'success' per 'trial' = <i>frac</i>). Summing up the binomial
                                distributions, each weighted by P(x_nt), for x_nt = 0,1,2,...,100
                                gives the amino acid Poisson and PCR P(x_aa) distributions. Of
                                course, Sum_{x_nt} P(x_nt) = Sum_{x_aa} P(x_aa) = <i>L_eff</i>
                                / <i>L_tot</i>. The Poisson and PCR amino acid sub-library sizes, Lx,
                                are given by P(x_aa) x <i>L_tot</i>.</p>
                            <p>
                                All these estimates rely on the mean number of nucleotide
                                substitutions per variant, <i>nsubst</i>, being relatively small
                                compared with the number of codons in the sequence, so that multiple
                                substitutions in the same codon are not very common. In practice, we
                                limit <i>nsubst</i> <= 0.1 x input sequence length (in
                                nucleotides). In fact, for the Poisson case, we can calculate L0, L1
                                and L2 exactly (a sum over all possible variants with exactly 0, 1 or
                                2 amino acid substitutions, multiplied by their probabilities given by
                                the input nucleotide substitution matrix and <i>nsubst</i>, multiplied
                                by <i>L_tot</i>). These calculations agree very well with the 'sum of
                                binomial distributions' method. For example, for the library
                                presented in Volles & Lansbury (2005), we have
                            <pre>
              'exact'       'binomial sum'
      L0     3.763e+05         3.861e+05
      L1     8.174e+05         8.205e+05
      L2     8.795e+05         8.717e+05
</pre>
                            </li>

                            <li> Two estimates of Vx are calculated. The first, Vx_1, is an
                                estimate of the number of 'common' variants with exactly x amino acid
                                substitutions - namely those variants where each substituted amino
                                acid is accessible by just a single nucleotide substitution in the
                                respective codon. The second, Vx_2, is the total number of possible
                                amino acid variants with exactly x amino acid substitutions. Although
                                most variants in a sub-library will be of type Vx_1, variants of type
                                Vx_2 may contribute significantly to the total number of distinct
                                variants Cx when the sub-library size Lx is large compared with the
                                number of variants Vx_1. When the sub-library size Lx is small
                                compared with the number of variants Vx_1, nearly every variant in Lx
                                is distinct (i.e. Cx ~ Lx) and it doesn't matter whether these
                                variants are of type Vx_1 or Vx_2.
                            </li>

                            <ul>

                                <li>Vx_2 is given by C(N,x) 19^x, where C(N,x) is the combinatorial
                                    function, i.e. C(N,x) = N!/[x!(N-x)!], and N is the length of
                                    the input sequence in codons. (Cf equation (5) of the
                                    <a href="/static/pedelAA_math_notes.pdf">mathematical notes</a> for the nucleotide

                                <li>We estimate Vx_1 with the formula C(N,x) A^x, where A is the
                                    mean number of non-synonymous amino acid substitutions
                                    accessible by a single nucleotide substitution, for the input
                                    sequence (the value of A is given on the results page).

                            single nucleotide substitution is calculated. Such substitutions are
                            accessible with similar probability (albeit varying by a factor of ~3
                            for a typical transition:transversion ratio) and much higher
                            probability than amino acid substitutions only accessible via 2 or 3
                            nucleotide substitutions in the same codon (except in the case of a
                            short parent sequence and/or high mutation rate). The Ai are averaged
                            (geometric mean) over the sequence to give the parameter A = (A1 x A2
                            x ... x An)^(1/N). A is typically around 5.8.</li>

                            <li> When Lx << Vx then Cx ~ Lx. For equiprobable variants this
                                approximation is good to 5% for Lx < 0.1 Vx (see the mathematical
                                <a href=../notes.pdf>notes</a> on the nucleotide version of PEDEL).
                                For PEDEL-AA, we use this approximation when Lx < 0.1 Vx_1 (the number
                                of 'easy-to-reach' variants) or more rigorously, and optionally, when
                                Rx < 0.1, where Rx is the mean frequency of the most common variant in
                                the sub-library Lx (see <a href="pedelAA_Rx">note on Rx
                                    statistic</a> for details). Lx < 0.1 Vx_1 is usually true for x
                                >= 3 and almost always true for x >= 4. For example for N >= 40
                                codons, V3_1 >= ~5.8^3 x C(40,3) = 1.9 x 10^6 and V4_1 >= ~5.8^4 x
                                C(40,4) = 1.0 x 10^8, while for N >= 100 codons, V3_1 >= ~5.8^3 x
                                C(100,3) = 3.1 x 10^7 and V4_1 >= ~5.8^4 x C(100,4) = 4.4 x 10^9; and
                                remember these Vx_1 sizes only need to be compared with the relevant
                                sub-library size L3 or L4, not the whole library size. In the Cx ~ Lx
                                region, whether a particular variant is of type Vx_1 or type Vx_2 is
                                irrelevant - either way it will (almost) always be a distinct variant
                                in the library.
                            </li>

                            <li> For x = 0, 1 and 2, we calculate the expected number of distinct
                                variants, Cx, precisely. This calculation includes variants with
                                multiple nucleotide substitutions in the same codon (i.e. both Vx_1
                                and Vx_2).

                                The total number of each of the 64 codon types in the input sequence
                                is calculated. The 64 x 20 matrix of probabilities for each codon
                                type mutating to each amino acid type is calculated using the input
                                nucleotide substitution matrix and the input substitution rate.

                                For x = 0, 1 and 2 there are, respectively Vx_2 = 1, 19N and
                                361N(N-1)/2 total possible variants (i.e. N!/[x!(N-x)!] 19^x, where N
                                is the length of the input sequence in codons). The probability of
                                the input sequence mutating to each of these possible variants is
                                calculated and renormalized by the respective probability sum P0, P1
                                or P2 (where Px = Sum_{v_i in Vx_2} P(v_i)) to give the normalized
                                probabilities Pn(v_i) of the different variants within the respective
                                sub-libraries Lx, rather than within the whole library. The
                                probability of a particular variant v_i being present in the relevant
                                sub-library Lx is given by 1 - exp(-Pn(v_i) x Lx). These
                                probabilities are quickly summed over all possible variants using the
                                codon counts. Computationally, this is very fast for x = 0, 1 and 2,
                                but can take a few minutes for x = 3; hence the 'exact' calculation is
                                not used on the webserver for x >= 3. The sizes of the sub-libraries
                                Lx are determined separately for the Poisson and PCR distributions as
                                described above, thus resulting in separate Cx estimates for the
                                different distributions.
                            </li>

                            <li> Ideally, for x >= 3, we will enter the Cx ~ Lx region. In this
                                case all the individual Cx estimates, and the estimated total number
                                of distinct variants in the library C = C0 + C1 + C2 + ..., will be
                                fairly good. A warning is printed in the 'notes' column of the output
                                table of sub-library statistics if there are any x >= 3 values for
                                which the Cx ~ Lx approximation may not apply, in which case Cx is
                                estimated with the formula Cx ~ Vx_1(1-exp(-Lx/Vx_1)) (i.e. ignoring,
                                in these particular sub-libraries, any variants of type Vx_2). This
                                formula is not very accurate and may result in an overestimate
                                (because the Vx_1 are not equiprobable - the higher probability amino
                                acid substitutions [e.g. those accessible by transitions, or via more
                                than one possible nucleotide substitution] will be over-represented at
                                the expense of other amino acid substitutions) or an underestimate
                                (since the Vx_2 variants are ignored). These effects can be quite a
                                large (e.g. if some Vx_1 substitutions are 3 times more likely than
                                others, and the Lx ~ Vx_1 turnover occurs at x ~ 3, then the most
                                common three-amino acid substitutions will be 3^3 = 27 times more
                                likely than the rarest three-amino acid substitutions).

                        <p>The 'Lx < 0.1 Vx_1' criterion assumes that all of the
                            single-nucleotide-substitution non-synonymous amino acid substitutions
                            are equiprobable - i.e. 1 in 5 in the above example, but in general
                            represented by the reciprocal of the 'A' factor described in
                            the above section,
                            where typically A ~ 5.8; whereas, in fact, the most common
                            single-nucleotide-substitution amino acid substitution (GGG -> Arg) is
                            4 x as likely as the rarest (GGG -> Trp or Ala or Val). In cases
                            where some nucleotide substitutions (as defined by the 4 x 4
                            nucleotide substitution matrix) are particularly rare, the probability
                            difference between the rarest and the most common
                            single-nucleotide-substitution amino acid substitutions at a given
                            site can be much greater.</p>
                        <p>The 'Lx < 0.1 Vx_1' criterion for being in the 'Cx ~ Lx' region
                            is
                            basically to make sure that there are enough variants in Vx to
                            'absorb' all Lx sub-library members so that (within a small error) at
                            most one sub-library member is equal to any given variant in Vx. In
                            practice, it doesn't matter what the probability of the rarest
                            variants is. What matters for the 'Cx ~ Lx' approximation is that the
                            mean frequency in Lx of the most common variant is < 0.1. In fact the
                            mean frequency of the most common variant in Lx, which we denote by
                            Rx, is easy to calculate for x = 0, 1, 2, ..., 20, ..., and is shown
                            in the PEDEL-AA output table of sub-library statistics.</p>
                        <p>Using these Rx values, the 'Lx < 0.1 Vx_1' criterion would be replaced
                            with the criterion 'Rx < 0.1'. In practice this means that if, in the
                            table of sub-library statistics, there are Rx values > 0.1, for which
                            the 'Cx ~ Lx' approximation has been used (i.e. x >= 3 and Lx < 0.1
                            Vx_1), then the particular corresponding Cx values may be
                            overestimates. A warning and html link are given in the table of
                            sub-library statistics whenever this occurs.</p></div>

                <p>In our paper (Firth &amp; Patrick, 2005), we assumed a Poisson
                    distribution to determine the fraction of sequences in an epPCR
                    library that contain exactly 0, 1, 2, 3, ... mutations, given the mean
                    number of mutations, <i>m</i>, per sequence.</p>
                <p>Since publication of Firth &amp Patrick (2005), however, Drummond et
                    al. (2005) have revisited the pioneering work of Sun (1995) and
                    provided experimental evidence in support of his more accurate
                    equation describing the distribution of <i>m</i>. This 'PCR
                    distribution' takes into account the number of PCR thermal cycles
                    <i>ncycles</i> and the PCR efficiency <i>eff</i> (i.e. the probability
                    that any particular sequence is duplicated in a given PCR cycle). We
                    have therefore now included the PCR distribution as an optional
                    alternative to the Poisson distribution in PEDEL.</p>
                <p>For large <i>m</i>, small <i>ncycles</i>, or low <i>eff</i>, the PCR
                    distribution is broader than the Poisson distribution. For low
                    <i>m</i>, large <i>ncycles</i> and large <i>eff</i>, the PCR
                    distribution approximates the Poisson distribution.
                    In a 'typical' epPCR (e.g. <i>ncycles</i> = 30, <i>eff</i> = 0.6,
                    <i>m</i> = 4), the estimated total number of distinct sequences in a
                    library typically agrees to within 5% for the two distributions, though
                    the sub-library statistics can show more variation.</p>
                <p>If you know <i>ncycles</i> and <i>eff</i>, then we recommend that you
                    use the PCR distribution instead of the Poisson distribution.
                    Drummond et al. (2005) use the formula <i>d</i> =
                    <i>ncycles</i> &times <i>eff</i>, where <i>d</i> is the number of
                    doublings. For example, if you start with 10^9 identical parent
                    sequences and amplify them in an epPCR to 10^15 sequences, then you
                    have had about <i>d</i> = 20 doublings (10^9 &times 2^20 ~= 10^15),
                    and you can calculate <i>eff</i> = <i>d</i> &divide; <i>ncycles</i>.
                    Actually the <i>d</i> = <i>ncycles</i> &times <i>eff</i> formula is
                    wrong. The correct formula is 2^d = (1+eff)^ncycles, so that the
                    efficiency is given by eff = 2^(d/ncycles) -
                    1 (<a href=/cgi-bin/aef/PCReff.pl>PCR efficiency calculator</a>).</p>

                <h2 id="pedelAA_exact">PEDEL-AA x = 0, 1 and 2 sub-library statistics</h2>
                <p>For x = 0, 1 and 2, we calculate the expected number of distinct
variants, Cx, precisely.  This calculation includes variants with
                    multiple nucleotide substitutions in the same codon.</p>
<p>
The total number of each of the 64 codon types in the input sequence
is calculated.  The 64 x 20 matrix of probabilities for each codon
type mutating to each amino acid type is calculated using the input
nucleotide substitution matrix and the input substitution rate.</p>
<p>For x = 0, 1 and 2 there are, respectively Vx_2 = 1, 19N and
361N(N-1)/2 total possible <a href=pedel-AA_variants.html>variants</a>
(i.e. N!/[x!(N-x)!] 19^x, where N is the length of the input sequence
in codons).  The probability of the input sequence mutating to each of
these possible variants is calculated and renormalized by the
respective probability sum P0, P1 or P2 (where Px = Sum_{v_i in Vx_2}
P(v_i)) to give the normalized probabilities Pn(v_i) of the different
variants within the respective sub-libraries Lx, rather than within
the whole library.  The probability of a particular variant v_i
being present in the relevant sub-library Lx is given by 1 -
exp(-Pn(v_i) x Lx).  These probabilities are quickly summed over all
possible variants using the codon counts.  Computationally, this is
very fast for x = 0, 1 and 2, but can take a few minutes for x = 3; hence
the 'exact' calculation is not used on the webserver for x >= 3.  The
sizes of the sub-libraries Lx are determined separately for the
Poisson and PCR distributions as described in
the <a href=pedel-AA-stats.html>notes on the PEDEL-AA algorithms</a>,
thus resulting in separate Cx estimates for the different
distributions.</p>
<p>Ideally, for x >= 3, we will enter the <a href=pedel-AA_CxLx.html>Cx ~
Lx</a> region.  In this case all the individual Cx estimates, and the
estimated total number of distinct variants in the library C = C0 + C1
+ C2 + ..., will be fairly good.  A warning is printed in the 'notes'
column if there are any x >= 3 values for which the Cx ~ Lx
approximation may not apply, in which case Cx is estimated with the
formula Cx ~ Vx_1(1-exp(-Lx/Vx_1)) (i.e. ignoring, in these particular
sub-libraries, any <a href=pedel-AA_variants.html>variants</a> of type
Vx_2).</p>
<p>See also <a href=pedel-AA-stats.html>notes on the PEDEL-AA
algorithms</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pedelAA_CxLx">PEDEL-AA Cx ~ Lx region</h2>

<p>When Lx << Vx then Cx ~ Lx.  For equiprobable variants this
approximation is good to 5% for Lx < 0.1 Vx (see the mathematical
<a href=../notes.pdf>notes</a> on PEDEL).  For PEDEL-AA, we use this
approximation when Lx < 0.1 Vx_1 (the number of 'easy-to-reach'
    variants).</p>
                <p>See also <a href=pedel-AA_exact.html>notes on the 'exact'
calculations</a> and <a href=pedel-AA-stats.html>notes on the PEDEL-AA
algorithms</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pedelAA_warningRx">PEDEL-AA Rx warning</h2>
<p>
For x = 0, 1 and 2, we calculate the expected number of distinct
variants, Cx, <a href=pedel-AA_exact.html>precisely</a>.  When Lx <
0.1 Vx_1 (i.e. for large x values), we use
the <a href=pedel-AA_CxLx.html>Cx ~ Lx</a> approximation.  Sometimes
using the criterion 'Lx < 0.1 Vx_1' to determine whether or not we are
in the 'Cx ~ Lx' region is not sufficient.  This is indicated by the
corresponding Rx value not being < 0.1.  In this case the
corresponding Cx value may be an overestimate.</p><p>

criterion</a> and
