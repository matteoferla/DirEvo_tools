<p>This page is part of a series of apps designed to help you with your mutagenesis.</p>
<h3>Diversity</h3>
<p>If you just used MutantCaller to assess the diversity of sequences, once you know your cloning worked, you can estimate the mutational load, bias and redundancy with the app <a href="/main/mutanalyst">Mutanalyst</a>.</p>
<p>If you are unhappy with the mutational load (if any), you can always take a step back and replan your experiment, using the <a href="/main/planner">planner app</a>.</p>
<h3>Winners</h3>
<p>If you just used MutantCaller to look at your winners from a selection, and are confused by the fact you got what looks like a good mutation and a bad one and would like to know the probability of having in the library one of those mutations without the other, then go to the <a href="/main/probably"> Chances page</a>.</p>
