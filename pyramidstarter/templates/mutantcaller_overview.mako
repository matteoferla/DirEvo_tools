<p>This page allows the identification of mutations in AB1 and get the corresponding amino acid mutation for both homogeneous and heterogeneous sites.</p>
<h3>Heterogeneous sites</h3>
<p>Whereas anything called differently or as a degenerate base in the AB1 automatic calling is interpreted, secondary peaks are only considered if they are above a given background noise threshold.</p>
<p>The noise is calculated from the average variation in secondary peaks. This is generally fairly unless there is a strong contaminant or there is a frameshift in part of the pool, which would be visible as a sudden increase in noise in the noise plot.</p>

<h3>Alignment</h3>
<p>The app does not do a sophisticated alignments as there is no need &mdash;there should be one or two mutations different.</p>
<p>If you get garbage out, you may have a contaminant, in which case your best bet is to <a href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch">blast it</a> to find out where it came from.</p>
